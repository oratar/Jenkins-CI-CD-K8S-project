# Jenkins-CI-CD-K8S-project

This repository serves as a practical example of setting up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a Dotnet application on an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster. 
The pipeline automates the building of the application, creation of a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, deploying it to the AKS cluster, and exposing a service for access.
